## MDI Split Plane


</div>

### Description

I have been able to find many Splitters that would split two areas on a single form, but what I needed was a Splitter in the way of being able to resize a control that was Right Aligned to an MDI Form - in this case, a PictureBox. This can easily be adapted to the Left, Top and Bottom. Check it out, it is worth trying. I am working towards making this into an ActiveX control once I have the logic nailed down. I'd appreciate any votes that you might feel like giving.
